# Some of my work
## Drone Stabiliztion
I have worked with PID System, (a subset of Control Theory) specially on Drone Sabilization and I have learn how autonomus system works such as how the spaceship fly on desired path how chandrayan was follwing the exact trajectory which was precalulated, this all comes under control theory. Below are some of the photos and video links attachd:

## Gcode and how machines know where to go

I always wonderd how the machince even know what task to do and how they preciley know where to go espceally in robotics i have learned this when I was working on an pen ploting machine and got a little furture when there was an event in my college (on science day) called Rongoli competition. I build a Rongoli making machince I have learnt a lot (Gcode, Motor controller,devloping and designing a machanical system) while solving such problem and devloped a critical way of thinking.

## Emission spectrum of a tube light 

In my FYBSc we had a topic named LASER and we learned about absorption and stimulated emission etc, I wanted to see by myself, first thought was to make a LASER but it was too expensive so I thought I can make a tesla coil which can generate this EM radiations of certain Band of frequency (at ressonace frequency) which can match with the Energy diffrence of two levels so, that certain frequency can make engough energy to exiced the electrons by the formula as h*(freq) = (E2-E1). In this wave i also how this line spectrum tell crusial information aboout the atomic composition of the source such as star etc. in future we can automate by Deep learing to find the atomic composition.

## Turbulent and laminar flow

Wanted to know how laminar flow works and what is the terminal point after which it starts to get turbulent in nature. Also

Other:
I have many minor and major projects but most of them were not documented as it was my curocity to know and initally was not a fount of kepping it documented
